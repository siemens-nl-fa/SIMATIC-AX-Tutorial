- have created your very own application in AX

## :raised_hands: Create your own code (hands-on) :raised_hands:
Time to put your creativity and AX knowledge to the test, create your own application or add a new function into the project. You can create whatever you like, might be good to follow these steps;
- What are you going to make?
- How often is this required to run?
- What is needed to verify the functionality?
- First write your unit tests, since you allready know how to verify your functionality.
- Start programming your application, you might want to do this with [OOP](https://console.simatic-ax.siemens.io/docs/st/language/oop) in mind.
- Unit test your functionality, verify if the functions are working like you would expect.
- Integrate the succesfully tested functionalities into the application.
- Build and load the application.
- Debugging and tracing is usefull to check the actual behaviour in the PLC.
